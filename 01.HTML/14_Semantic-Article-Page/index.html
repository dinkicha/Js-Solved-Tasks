        <h1>Apple</h1>
        <p>Published: 9th October, 2009</p>
        <p>
            An <strong>apple</strong> is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple
            tree (Malus pumila). Apple trees are<br />
            cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus
            Malus.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus
            sieversii, is still found today.<br />
            Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and
            were brought to North<br />
            America by European colonists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures,
            including Norse, Greek and<br />
            European Christian traditions.
