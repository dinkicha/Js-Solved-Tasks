        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an<br> hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of<br> <em>Nature, New Scientist</em>, and all the other scientific<br> journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed<br> copy of <em>On The Road</em>. It had been Molly's favourite<br> book since college, and the longer she spent in these<br> four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting<br> under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming<br> that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing<br> better to do</q>.</p>
